how to properly assign classes names in BEM structure for that scheme (there are no modifiers):

<div>
      <div>
        <p>1</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="text" placeholder="Input text" />
        <div>
          <img
            src="images/search-button.jpg"
            alt="Search"
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

In BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology, class names are structured to provide a clear understanding of the relationships between different parts of your HTML structure. Here's how you could assign class names to the elements in your provided HTML structure:

html
Copy code

<div class="block">
  <div class="block__element">
    <p class="block__element-inner">1</p>
  </div>
  <div class="block__element">
    <input class="block__element-input" type="text" placeholder="Input text" />
    <div class="block__element-inner">
      <img class="block__element-image" src="images/search-button.jpg" alt="Search" />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
In this example, I've used "block" as the main block name, "element" as the element name, and "inner" to signify a sub-element within the main element. Remember, the naming itself doesn't have strict rules, but consistency is key. Here's a breakdown of the class names:

.block: Represents the main component or container.
.block**element: Represents an element within the main component.
.block**element-inner: Represents a sub-element within an element (you can modify this according to your specific needs).
.block**element-input: Represents a specific input element within an element.
.block**element-image: Represents an image element within an element.
Keep in mind that BEM encourages using only one level of nesting. In your case, the structure seems relatively simple, so the nesting level doesn't need to go deeper.

Also, remember that BEM is just one approach to naming conventions, and there are other methodologies and variations out there. The most important thing is to choose a naming convention that suits your team's workflow and stick to it consistently.
